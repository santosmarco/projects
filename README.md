### 1. Nova A3 Web App

[![Company: Nova A3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Company-Nova%20A3-informational)](https://www.novaa3.com.br) ![Stack: TypeScript + React + Firebase + NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stack-TypeScript%20+%20React%20+%20Firebase%20+%20NodeJS-blueviolet)

**[Go to project](https://app.novaa3.com.br)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| or: _[Go to repo](https://github.com/Nova-A3/na3-app)_

A React app developed for Nova A3, a plastics industry, to broader connect their entire factory by providing an easy-to-use, batteries-included interface that automates plenty of their previously paper-based processes.

<details>
       <summary>See background</summary>

**Background:** Nova A3 had always been a paper-based company, i.e. they used mainly pure sheets of paper to describe all of their internal processes. Then, various dedicated employees were there only to transfer these hand-wrote data into Excel sheets.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>See detailed solution</summary>

**Solution:** This fully responsive web platform was created to change that! It currently supports opening/tracking orders for maintenance service on any of Nova A3's machines, user-friendly label printing based on automatically populated templates (with data fetched from our database of clients and products), and document issuing.

</details>

### 2. Nova A3 App Companion

[![Company: Nova A3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Company-Nova%20A3-informational)](https://www.novaa3.com.br) ![Stack: TypeScript + React Native + Firebase](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stack-TypeScript%20+%20React%20Native%20+%20Firebase-blueviolet)

**[Go to project](https://expo.dev/@santosmarco/na3-manut)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| or: _[Go to repo](https://github.com/Nova-A3/na3-manut-mobile)_

A React Native app built to serve as companion for the [web-based one.](#1-nova-a3-web-app) Although the web app has been fully designed to be responsive on all screen sizes, it lacked some crucial mobile features, like notifications.

<details>
       <summary>See background</summary>

**Background:** Once the most outdated processes of Nova A3 have entered the digital era, we noticed that we could make them way more effective if they had access to important mobile features, like push notifications and precision-based geolocation information.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>See detailed solution</summary>

**Solution:** This companion app has been developed to provide a better, more robust interface between our employees and our new, digital way of doing things inside Nova A3, by allowing us to implement push notifications, camera- and geolocation-based features, among many others, into this new ecosystem.

### 3. Invoice & Packing List Generator

[![Company: Nova A3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Company-Nova%20A3-informational)](https://www.novaa3.com.br) ![Stack: React + Firebase](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stacks-React%20+%20Firebase-blueviolet)

**[Go to project](https://na3-comex-invpl.web.app)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| or: _[Go to repo](https://github.com/santosmarco/na3-comex-invpl)_

This React-based project consists of a Bootstrap-styled form connected to a Firebase's Firestore, through which it is possible to generate an Invoice and a Packing List for Nova A3's export processes.

<details>
       <summary>See background</summary>

**Background:** Nova A3 needed a modern solution that had the potential of speeding up the process of issuing Invoices and Packing Lists for their exportations, as these procedures had always been done manually through various Excel files.

</details>

<details>
    <summary>See detailed solution</summary>

**Solution:** I developed this platform not only to make the issuance of these documents a lot easier and faster, but also to also make them more aesthetically appealing. It was a game-changer for Nova A3's Import/Export department!

### 1. GIDEN

![Rank: 2nd](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-2nd-success) [![Hackathon: Empreenda Getnet](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hackathon-Empreenda%20Getnet-informational)](https://www.hackathongetnet.com.br/) ![Role: Dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/Role-Dev-blueviolet) ![Stack: React](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stack-React-blueviolet)

**[Go to project](https://getnet-giden.web.app/)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| or: _[Watch the pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdDH_98dt8A&feature=youtu.be)_ • _[Watch the demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtqKoDpqo58&feature=youtu.be)_ • _[Download PDF](https://storage.googleapis.com/shawee-production.appspot.com/shawee/projectfiles/4132bce9-66b6-4877-b879-93f180fca584.pdf)_ • _[Go to repo](https://github.com/Hacka-GIDEN)_

A chatbot developed on top of React that interprets various aspects of a entrepreneur's starting business and then classify him accordingly, with a score ranging from zero to 1,000.

<details>
<summary>See background</summary>

**Background:** This hackathon's challenge consisted of developing a way to change reality and boost the revenue of small and medium-sized companies in Brazil, through the offer of different kinds of financial service.

</details>

<details>
<summary>See detailed solution</summary>

**Solution:** Alongside amazing people, we developed a chatbot platform that interacts naturally with its user. Through simple and focused questions, a Machine Learning algorithm is able to draw a sketch of this person's profile and score it accordingly. We then send this score to creditor institutions, while also feeding the user back with smart, customized recommendations on various management and entrepreneurship courses, based on their overall performance on the conversation.

### 2. FoodHero

![Rank: 3rd](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-3rd-success) [![Hackathon: Children's Health (Desiderata)](<https://img.shields.io/badge/Hackathon-Children's%20Health%20(Desiderata)-informational>)](https://www.hackathonsaudeinfantil.com.br/) ![Track: Obesity](https://img.shields.io/badge/Track-Obesity-informational) ![Role: Dev](https://img.shields.io/badge/Role-Dev-blueviolet) ![Stack: React](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stack-React-blueviolet)

**[Go to project](https://hacka-foodhero.web.app/)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| or: _[Watch the pitch](https://youtu.be/VuYAycbOKw8)_ • _[Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/JyqimGBeSss)_ • _[Download PDF](https://storage.googleapis.com/shawee-production.appspot.com/shawee/projectfiles/6011408e-60c2-4965-98e1-fac27d5f9456.pdf)_ • _[Go to repo](https://github.com/santosmarco/hacka-foodhero)_

A mobile game in which the user earns valuable virtual points by battling against other players. These points and battles are part of various in-game goals aimed at keeping the user's diet balanced and his/her lifestyle healthy. We then certify the fulfillment of these objectives through a ML algorithm capable of recognizing foods.

<details>
<summary>See background</summary>

**Background:** Our challenge was to develop a solution to significantly improve in terms of efficiency the gathering and treatment of information that influence childhood obesity, such as food consumption markers, anthropometric data, among others.

</details>

<details>
<summary>See detailed solution</summary>

**Solution:** We understand that the inefficiency in the gathering and treatment of these types of data has its roots mainly in those children that have no idea on how to contribute and also in the adults that do not have the will/time to do so. Thus, we developed a game for children and young people, through which they send this kind of information out naturally and imperceptibly to all interested parties, friction-less.

### 3. RocketMusic

![Rank: Participant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rank-Participant-green) [![Hackathon: 2nd code/stage (Sony Music))](<https://img.shields.io/badge/Hackathon-2nd%20code/stage%20(Sony%20Music)-informational>)](https://www.codestage.com.br/) ![Role: Business](https://img.shields.io/badge/Role-Business-9cf)

**[Go to project](https://sony-rocketmusic.web.app/)**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| or: _[Watch the pitch](https://youtu.be/YZe5zA4CQtA)_ • _[Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/NA7MJ1UxRnA)_ • _[Download PDF](https://storage.googleapis.com/shawee-production.appspot.com/shawee/projectfiles/9bcebf8f-9d90-473b-b3e5-0d9509095488.pdf)_ • _[Go to repo](https://github.com/rocketmusic)_

RocketMusic is a startup of data gathering and processing, which, through extensive Machine Learning algorithms, provides all the visibility some artists struggle hard to obtain, by efficiently promoting them on various streaming platforms, and also by sending those that perform best to well-known artist management companies.

<details>
<summary>See background</summary>

**Background:** This hackathon's challenge was to create a way to improve the overall experience of music consumers, while also boosting the artistic market, through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

</details>

<details>
<summary>See detailed solution</summary>

**Solution:** Together, our team developed a kind of plugin for streaming platforms (e.g., Spotify) that, with the help of extensive and complex AI and Machine Learning algorithms, sporadically and intelligently injected music from unknown but promising artists into some of the user's playlists.
Depending on the user's interaction with one song, the platform got to know if they liked it or not. Did they skip it in the first few seconds? Disliked. Did they let the music playing? Did like!
Those artists who received the most likes would have their songs presented more often to this and other users, therefore being organically promoted.

Long, expensive processes and high operational demand are part of every investment fund. By deeply analyzing two vital players of this industry — the fund's management council and the Controller - FundData uses AI and Machine Learning to centralize data, and therefore streamlines the information flow (thus reducing the workload of the back-office), while also checking for inconsistencies and possible fraudulent operations.

<details>
<summary>See background</summary>

**Background:** Our challenge was to come up with an innovative solution to significantly improve the lives of those who provide services to investment funds.

### _Note_

Unlike most of the above-mentioned Hackathon Projects, links for the project, its repository, pitch video and demo video are _not_ listed in any of the projects below. That's because:

- Coding is not a requirement of Google Startup Weekends; and
- Personally-attended events make sharing much harder, as they happen live.
